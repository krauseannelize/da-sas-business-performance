## About the Challenge

As part of the Data Analytics Module of Masterschool's [Orientation Course](https://de.masterschool.com/en/domains/orientation-course/), we received a data analysis challenge to create a Data Analysis Report. Deliverables are:

- Analysis and visualizations in Google Sheets
- Written report of answering key questions in Google Docs

We are encouraged to use AI as much as possible to guide the analysis and interpretation. The report should answer these 7 key questions, as well as an additional 3 of our own:

- **80/20 Analysis**: Which 20% of products, customers, or categories generate 80% of revenue?  It doesnâ€™t have to be exactly 20 and 80, but are there some products, customers and categories significantly more important than others?
- **Product Lifecycle**: How many products have been discontinued, and when was the last order for each? What patterns do you notice?
- **Time Series Completeness**: Does the dataset include only full years and months? If not, how should we adjust our time-based revenue analysis?
- **Regional Performance**: Which countries or cities contribute most to revenue and profit? Is there untapped potential in specific regions?
- **Customer Loyalty**: What percentage of revenue comes from repeat vs. new customers? How does order frequency correlate with customer value?
- **Inventory Management**: Which products are at risk of stockouts? Which have excess inventory relative to their sales velocity?
- **Price Point Analysis**: How do different price points perform across categories? Is there an optimal price range for maximum profit?

With the assistance of AI-powered tools, which provided suggestions based on best practices in data analysis and relevance to executive decision-making, I added the following 3 questions:

- **Profitability Trends**: How have profit margins and profits evolved over time? What factors are driving changes in profitability, and are there any areas of concern to address?
- **Demand Forecasting**: What is the projected demand for the next quarter/year, and how can inventory be optimized and production planned to meet this demand effectively? What are the potential risks and opportunities associated with these forecasts?
- **Shipping Carrier Performance**: Which shipping carrier is the fastest on average? Which is the most cost-effective?

## My analysis

This project provided an opportunity to apply data analysis and visualization techniques to solve a real-world business problem. I refined key insights into profitability trends, sales volume patterns, and demand forecasting. Leveraging AI tools enabled me to address complex questions efficiently, enhance the depth of my analysis, and streamline documentation efforts.

This reflection underscores the value of combining structured methodologies with innovative technologies to deliver actionable insights and drive decision-making.
